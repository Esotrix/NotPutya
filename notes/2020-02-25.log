Analysis warning:

PDB> Incomplete PDB information (GUID/Signature and/or age) associated with this program.
Either the program is not a PE, or it was not compiled with debug information.
Windows x86 PE RTTI Analyzer> Couldn't find type info structure.

This is probably fine since it seems illogical to include debug information with malware.
